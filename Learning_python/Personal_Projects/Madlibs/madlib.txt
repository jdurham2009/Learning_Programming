~~~Office Shenanigans~~~
It was just another day at the office when the MailMan got caught Running with a table in the break room.
Everyone knew it was going to be a funny kind of day.
I walked into the bathroom with my morning coffee and saw Beyonce giving a motivational speech
to the interns about the importance of keeping your boob clean and your Eiffle Tower charged.
Suddenly, someone yelled, Woah! and the printer cried into flames.
The Firefighter tried to fix it by smacking it and yelling kakakakak but honestly, that just made things worse.
At that point, I was so elated I almost fell off my knee.

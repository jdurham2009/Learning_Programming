~~~Office Shenanigans~~~
It was just another day at the office when the 34 got caught 34 with a 3 in the break room.
Everyone knew it was going to be a 4 kind of day.
I walked into the 5 with my morning 6 and saw 7 giving a motivational speech
to the interns about the importance of keeping your 8 clean and your 9 charged.
Suddenly, someone yelled, 8 and the printer 7 into flames.
The 6 tried to fix it by smacking it and yelling 5 but honestly, that just made things worse.
At that point, I was so 4 I almost fell off my 3.

It was just another day at the office when the 34 got caught 34 with a 23 in the break room.
Everyone knew it was going to be a 22 kind of day.
I walked into the 4 with my morning 5 and saw 6 giving a motivational speech
to the interns about the importance of keeping your 7 clean and your 8 charged.
Suddenly, someone yelled, 7 and the printer 6 into flames.
The 5 tried to fix it by smacking it and yelling 4 but honestly, that just made things worse.
At that point, I was so 3 I almost fell off my 2.

Issues Faces:
- Can get the input to point to the function but cannot get function to return results.

import csv

def find_university():
    choice = input("Which University do you want to search?:\n").strip().lower()

    with open("University_Tech_Programs.csv", mode="r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        
        found = False
        for row in reader:
            if row["University_Name"].strip().lower() == choice:
                print(row)  # prints the entire row as a dictionary
                found = True
                break  # remove this if you want to find multiple matches

        if not found:
            print("No matching university found.")

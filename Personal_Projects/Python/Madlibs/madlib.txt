~~~Office Shenanigans~~~
It was just another day at the office when the MailMan got caught Running with a table in the break room.
Everyone knew it was going to be a funny kind of day.
I walked into the bathroom with my morning coffee and saw Beyonce giving a motivational speech
to the interns about the importance of keeping your boob clean and your Eiffle Tower charged.
Suddenly, someone yelled, Woah! and the printer cried into flames.
The Firefighter tried to fix it by smacking it and yelling kakakakak but honestly, that just made things worse.
At that point, I was so elated I almost fell off my knee.

~~~It's About Time~~~
Thousands of 3 ago, there were calendars that enabled the ancient 34
to divide a year into twelve 5, each month into 5 weeks,
and each week into seven 6. At first, people told time by a sun clock,
sometimes known as the 6. Ultimately, they invented the great timekeeping devices of today,
such as the grandfather 6, the pocket 6, the alarm 6, and, of course, the,
5 watch. Children learn about clocks and time almost before they learn their AB5.
They are taught that a day consists of 24 4, an hour has 60 4,
and a minute has 60 3. By the time they are in kindergarten, they know if the big
3 is at twelve and the little 3 is at three, that it is 3.
I wish we could continue this 4 lesson, but weve run out of 5.

~~~Office Shenanigans~~~
It was just another day at the office when the 34 got caught 3 with a 45 in the break room.
Everyone knew it was going to be a 65 kind of day.
I walked into the 76 with my morning 56 and saw 45 giving a motivational speech
to the interns about the importance of keeping your 34 clean and your 3 charged.
Suddenly, someone yelled, 23 and the printer 23 into flames.
The 34 tried to fix it by smacking it and yelling 45 but honestly, that just made things worse.
At that point, I was so 6 I almost fell off my 7.
